# Cadence's Programming Language Pillars
* Safety and Security
* Clarity
* Approachability
* Developer Experience
* Resource Oriented Programming

**Q2. In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful.** </br>
**A2.** When I venture into something new, like a new programming language, the first thing I look for is the approachability and clarity factor. I prefer if it takes me less time to get used to the syntax,
because it becomes easier for me to understand and keep a track of what I am coding (especially when I am working with two different languages, suppose for two diff projects simultaneously).
If I am developing something, the feature of having an easy to read and debug an error is very useful, which the developer experience pillar provides. Finally, while working on a blockchain 
project which involves high-valued assets, one of the most essential things I would look for is the safety and security aspect. To have bug-free and safe ecosystem where malicious
attacks could be prevented is extremely valuable considering the nature of blockchains.

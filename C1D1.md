Q1: Explain what the Blockchain is in your own words.<br/>
A1: A blockchain is a database in which you can store encrypted blocks of data. As each transaction occurs, it is recorded as a block of data and these blocks form a chain of data as an asset is moved from point A to point B. Key elements of blockchain being the distributed database structure, immutability of transactions and smart contracts.

Q2: Explain what a Smart Contract is.<br/>
A2: Smart contracts is a program stored on the blockchain which defines an agreement like a "contract" with rules and conditions. Smart contracts can be interacted with, when pre-determined conditions are met, which will then execute a function that is defined on the smart contract.

Q3: Explain the difference between a script and a transaction.<br/>
A3: A transaction modifies the state of the blockchain and it also costs gas money to do so. Whereas a script only views the state of the blockchain and does not modify it (hence making it free).
